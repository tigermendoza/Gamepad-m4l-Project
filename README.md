A Max 4 Live interface for controlling a Ableton Live with an Xbox 360 / One Control pad

This is my third attempt at creating an interface to enable an Xbox 360 control pad to control functions within an Ableton Live session. As the name suggests, this version uses Max 4 Live (a version of Max MSP which opens natively within Ableton Live).
