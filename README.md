A Max 4 Live interface for controlling a Ableton Live with an Xbox 360 / One Control pad

This is my third attempt at creating an interface to enable an Xbox 360 control pad to control functions within an Ableton Live session. As the name suggests, this version uses Max 4 Live (a version of Max MSP which opens natively within Ableton Live).

So far I've tested this with a wireless Xbox 360 control pad via an official wireless usb adapter and a wireless Xbox One control pad via a USB cable on a Windows 10 PC. Both seem to work fine but I'd love to know if that's true for other people.

A massive thank you to Modul8tor for his Joystick Gamepad Control - m8r 1.0 device which is what I've based mine on. https://maxforlive.com/library/device/2051/joystick-gamepad-control-m8r

Please feel free to raise issues and feature requrests - I can't guarantee I'll get back in any reasonable time but I'll see what I can do. Also feel free to clone the whole repository and ake you're own version. Technically speaking a similar method can be used to map any game controller with some changes to the mappings between the HID outputs and ableton controls.  

Also just to note to say that this is my first M4L patch so please be gentle! :)

Thanks!
